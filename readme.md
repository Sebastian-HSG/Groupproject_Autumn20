# Group Project (Group ID 2248) - Weather Information with Python
Project language: Python

## About
This is a group project of three students for the course "Skills: Programming - Introduction Level" (course number 3,793,1.00) and the course "Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages" (course number 7,789,1.00) at the University of St.Gallen (HSG).
The goal of this project was to create a program in Python that displays weather information such as the current weather, the weather forecast, and historical weather data.
<!-- # Did we use existing code or existing tutorials that we should mention here? -->

## Pre-requisites
This program was developed for Python 3.9.  <!-- Do we want to add something along the lines of: it may work previous Python versions, but this has not (yet) been  tested? -->
In order to run this program, the following packages need to be installed:  #is packages the correct word or should this be libraries?
- requests (https://requests.readthedocs.io/)
- jason (https://github.com/runekaagaard/jason)
- EasyTkinter (https://pythonhosted.org/EasyTkinter/)
- DateTime (https://github.com/zopefoundation/DateTime)
- pytz (http://pythonhosted.org/pytz)
- geopy (https://github.com/geopy/geopy)
- fpdf (https://github.com/reingart/pyfpdf)

<!-- Should we have links here? -->

# Instructions
1. Start <weatherinformation_vX.X.py> <!-- Placeholder for the final file name -->
2. 
<!-- I don't know if this is something we can/should do, but is it worth it to consider making our program installable with pip? (E.g., pip install weatherinformation) -->
