# Group Project (Group ID 2248) - Weather Information with Python
Project language: Python

## About
This is a group project of three students for the course "Skills: Programming - Introduction Level" (course number 3,793,1.00) and the course "Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages" (course number 7,789,1.00) at the University of St.Gallen (HSG).
The goal of this project was to create a program in Python that displays weather information (e.g., the current weather and the weather forecast) based on a user's input (e.g., a location of interest).

## Pre-requisites
This program was developed for Python 3.9.  <!-- Do we want to add something along the lines of: it may work previous Python versions, but this has not (yet) been  tested? -->
In order to run this program, the following packages need to be installed:
- Requests (https://requests.readthedocs.io/)
- geopy (https://github.com/geopy/geopy)
- Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
- json (built-in in Python)
- Tkinter (built-in in Python)

The following API key is needed:
- OpenWeather (for the current version of this program, the free plan suffices; https://openweathermap.org/api)
