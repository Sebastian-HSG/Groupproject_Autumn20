## About
- This is a group project of three students (Ra√Øs Lall Mohamed, Tim Niedermann, and Sebastian Stein) for the course "Skills: Programming - Introduction Level" (course number 3,793,1.00) and the course "Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages" (course number 7,789,1.00) at the University of St.Gallen (HSG).
- The goal of this project was to create a program in Python that displays weather information (e.g., the current weather and the weather forecast) based on a user's input (e.g., a location of interest).

## Pre-requisites
1. Python version 3.9 (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- The program was developed for and tested with Python 3.9. The program may work with previous Python versions, but this was not tested.

2. The following packages are required for the program to work:
- requests (https://requests.readthedocs.io/)
- geopy (https://github.com/geopy/geopy)
- matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
- json [(built-in in Python 3)](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)
- tkinter [(built-in in Python 3)](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)
- pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)

3. An OpenWeather API key:
- OpenWeather (https://openweathermap.org/api)
- Please note, for feature 1, 3, and 4 (see below), the free OpenWeather plan suffices. However, for feature 2 (see below), "advanced weather maps" is required, which is part of the paid developer, professional, and enterprise plan (https://openweathermap.org/price).

## Instructions
1. Start weatherinformation_vX.X.py
2. Add your own OpenWeather API key.
3. Run the program. (*Tip: You can use an IDE such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to run this program.*)

## Program Description & Features
The the program offers the following features:
1. Get the current weather information for any city in the world ("Get Current Weather Information")
2. Get the current weather map of the world ("Get World Temperature Map")
3. Get the weather forecast (next hour) for any city in the world ("Get Weather Forecast (Next Hour)")
4. Get the temperature forecast (next 10 hours) for any city in the world ("Get Temperature Forecast (Next 10h)")
