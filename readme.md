- Project language: Python
- Group Project: Group ID 2248

## About
- This is a group project of three students for the course "Skills: Programming - Introduction Level" (course number 3,793,1.00) and the course "Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages" (course number 7,789,1.00) at the University of St.Gallen (HSG).
- The goal of this project was to create a program in Python that displays weather information (e.g., the current weather and the weather forecast) based on a user's input (e.g., a location of interest).

## Pre-requisites
1. Python version 3.9 (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- This program was developed for and tested with Python 3.9. The program may work with previous Python versions, but this was not tested.

2. The following packages are required for the program to work:
- requests (https://requests.readthedocs.io/)
- geopy (https://github.com/geopy/geopy)
- matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
- json [(built-in in Python 3)](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)
- tkinter [(built-in in Python 3)](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)

3. An OpenWeather API key:
- OpenWeather (https://openweathermap.org/api)
- For the current version of this program, the free plan suffices.

## Instructions
1. Start weatherinformation_vX.X.py
2. Add your own OpenWeather API key.
3. Run the program.

## Program Description
The current version of the program, weatherinformation_v1.0, offers the following features:
1. Get the current weather information for any city in the world.
2. Get the weather forecast (next hour) for any city in the world.
